> Transforming and analyzing data at scale.

## Overview

Data processing transforms raw data into analysis-ready datasets. This section covers the tools and patterns for processing data at scale.

## Key Topics

### [Apache Spark](spark.md)
Distributed data processing with Spark.

**Learn about:**
- Spark architecture
- RDDs, DataFrames, Datasets
- Optimization techniques
- Best practices

### [Google BigQuery](bigquery.md)
Serverless data warehouse and analytics.

**Learn about:**
- BigQuery architecture
- Query optimization
- Partitioning and clustering
- Cost optimization

## Processing Patterns

### Batch Processing

**When to use:**
- Large volumes
- No real-time requirement
- Complex transformations

**Tools:** Spark, BigQuery, Snowflake

### Streaming Processing

**When to use:**
- Real-time requirements
- Event-driven architecture
- Low-latency use cases

**Tools:** Flink, Spark Streaming, Dataflow
