# Data Platform Playbook

> A production-grade handbook for building and operating modern data platforms at scale.

## Welcome! 👋

**नमस्ते!** (Namaste - Welcome in India 🇮🇳)

This playbook provides **actionable, opinionated guidance** for data engineering teams operating at enterprise scale. It covers the full spectrum from foundational principles to advanced platform architecture, with a focus on **cost efficiency, reliability, and self-serve capabilities**.

## Who This Is For

- **Data Engineers** - Building and maintaining data pipelines and platforms
- **Data Engineering Managers** - Building and scaling data teams
- **Data Platform Managers** - Designing and operating platforms  
- **Staff / Principal Data Engineers** - Making architectural decisions
- **Platform Architects** - Designing enterprise data systems

## Core Principles

This playbook is built on these foundational principles:

- **📦 Data as a Product** - Treat data assets as first-class products with clear ownership, SLAs, and contracts
- **🔀 Separation of Concerns** - Clear boundaries between ingestion, transformation, storage, and serving
- **🚀 Platform Thinking** - Build self-serve capabilities that enable teams, not bottlenecks
- **💰 Cost Awareness** - Every architectural decision should consider cost implications
- **💡 Opinionated Guidance** - Clear recommendations, not generic explanations

## What You'll Learn

This playbook covers:

1. **Data Engineering** - Core concepts, lifecycle, platform thinking
2. **Data Ingestion** - Patterns, tools, and trade-offs for getting data in
3. **Data Architecture** - Storage design, lakehouse, partitioning
4. **Data Orchestration** - Scheduling, coordinating pipelines
5. **Data Processing** - Spark, BigQuery, distributed processing
6. **Data Quality** - Governance, checks, SLAs, observability

## Quotes

> "Data is a precious thing and will last longer than the systems themselves."
>
> **— Tim Berners-Lee**

> **"The biggest opportunity for managers isn't better data — it's making data problems understandable."**

> **"The next generation doesn't need more dashboards. They need better stories about why the data matters."**

> **"Data problems aren't boring. They're just badly explained."**

## Getting Started

!!! tip "New to Data Engineering?"
    Start with **[Data Engineering](data-engineering/index.md)** to understand core concepts and principles.

!!! success "Building a Platform?"
    Read **[Data Engineering → Platform & Operating Model](data-engineering/platform-operating-model.md)** first to design your operating model.

!!! warning "Optimizing Costs?"
    Jump to **[Data Engineering → Cost Efficiency](data-engineering/cost-efficiency.md)** for practical optimization strategies.

!!! info "Evaluating Architecture?"
    See **[Reference → Leadership View](reference/leadership-view.md)** for frameworks and metrics.
